        <h3>Jabberwocky</h3>
        <h3>by Lewis Carroll</h3>

            <pre>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

All mimsy were the borogoves,

    And the mome raths outgrabe.



<strong><em>"Beware the <span class="bold-red">Jabberwock</span>, my son!

    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!

Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

    The frumious Bandersnatch!"</em></strong>



He took his vorpal sword in hand;

    Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”

So rested he by the Tumtum tree

    And stood awhile in thought.
